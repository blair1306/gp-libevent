<doc f='codebrowser/include/event2/event.h' l='552'>/** If we are using the epoll backend, this flag says that it is
	    safe to use Libevent&apos;s internal change-list code to batch up
	    adds and deletes in order to try to do as few syscalls as
	    possible.  Setting this flag can make your code run faster, but
	    it may trigger a Linux bug: it is not safe to use this flag
	    if you have any fds cloned by dup() or its variants.  Doing so
	    will produce strange and hard-to-diagnose bugs.

	    This flag can also be activated by setting the
	    EVENT_EPOLL_USE_CHANGELIST environment variable.

	    This flag has no effect if you wind up using a backend other than
	    epoll.
