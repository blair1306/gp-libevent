   A flag used to describe which features an event_base (must) provide.

   Because of OS limitations, not every Libevent backend supports every
   possible feature.  You can use this type with
   event_config_require_features() to tell Libevent to only proceed if your
   event_base implements a given feature, and you can receive this type from
   event_base_get_features() to see which features are available.
