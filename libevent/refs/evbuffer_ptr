    Pointer to a position within an evbuffer.

    Used when repeatedly searching through a buffer.  Calling any function
    that modifies or re-packs the buffer contents may invalidate all
    evbuffer_ptrs for that buffer.  Do not modify or contruct these values
    except with evbuffer_ptr_set.

    An evbuffer_ptr can represent any position from the start of a buffer up
    to a position immediately after the end of a buffer.
