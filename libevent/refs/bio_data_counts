   Now, here&apos;s the OpenSSL-based implementation of bufferevent.

   The implementation comes in two flavors: one that connects its SSL object
   to an underlying bufferevent using a BIO_bufferevent, and one that has the
   SSL object connect to a socket directly.  The latter should generally be
   faster, except on Windows, where your best bet is using a
   bufferevent_async.

   (OpenSSL supports many other BIO types, too.  But we can&apos;t use any unless
   we have a good way to get notified when they become readable/writable.)
