<doc f='codebrowser/include/event2/http.h' l='1144'>/** Tolerate URIs that do not conform to RFC3986.
 *
 * Unfortunately, some HTTP clients generate URIs that, according to RFC3986,
 * are not conformant URIs.  If you need to support these URIs, you can
 * do so by passing this flag to evhttp_uri_parse_with_flags.
 *
 * Currently, these changes are:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 *   &lt;li&gt; Nonconformant URIs are allowed to contain otherwise unreasonable
 *        characters in their path, query, and fragment components.
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
