   Flag for creating evbuffer_file_segment: Disable direct fd-to-fd
   implementations (including sendfile and splice).

   You might want to use this option if data needs to be taken from the
   evbuffer by any means other than writing it to the network: the sendfile
   backend is fast, but it only works for sending files directly to the
   network.
