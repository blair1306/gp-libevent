<doc f='codebrowser/include/event2/buffer.h' l='191'>/** If this flag is set, then we will not use evbuffer_peek(),
 * evbuffer_remove(), evbuffer_remove_buffer(), and so on to read bytes
 * from this buffer: we&apos;ll only take bytes out of this buffer by
 * writing them to the network (as with evbuffer_write_atmost), by
 * removing them without observing them (as with evbuffer_drain),
 * or by copying them all out at once (as with evbuffer_add_buffer).
 *
 * Using this option allows the implementation to use sendfile-based
 * operations for evbuffer_add_file(); see that function for more
 * information.
 *
 * This flag is on by default for bufferevents that can take advantage
 * of it; you should never actually need to set it on a bufferevent&apos;s
 * output buffer.
