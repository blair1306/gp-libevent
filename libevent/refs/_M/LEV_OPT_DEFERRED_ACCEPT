<doc f='codebrowser/include/event2/listener.h' l='77'>/** Flag: Indicates that the listener should defer accept() until data is
 * available, if possible.  Ignored on platforms that do not support this.
 *
 * This option can help performance for protocols where the client transmits
 * immediately after connecting.  Do not use this option if your protocol
 * _doesn&apos;t_ start out with the client transmitting data, since in that case
 * this option will sometimes cause the kernel to never tell you about the
 * connection.
 *
 * This option is only supported by evconnlistener_new_bind(): it can&apos;t
 * work with evconnlistener_new_fd(), since the listener needs to be told
 * to use the option before it is actually bound.
